# Caesar

## Problem to Solve

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by
shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …, and,
wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP instead. Upon
receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to “decrypt” them by shifting letters in the opposite
direction by the same number of places.

The secrecy of this “cryptosystem” relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by
which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you’re perhaps
the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!

Unencrypted text is generally called  _plaintext_. Encrypted text is generally called  _ciphertext_. And the secret used
is called a  _key_.

To be clear, then, here’s how encrypting  `HELLO`  with a key of 1 yields  `IFMMP`:

| plaintext | + key |   | plaintext | = ciphertext |
|-----------|-------|---|-----------|--------------|
| H         | 1     |   | H         | I            |
| E         | 1     |   | E         | F            |
| L         | 1     |   | L         | M            |
| L         | 1     |   | L         | M            |
| O         | 1     |   | O         | P            |

More formally, Caesar’s algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by “rotating” each letter by 𝑘 positions. More
formally, if 𝑝 is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), 𝑝𝑖 is the 𝑖𝑡ℎ character in 𝑝, and 𝑘 is a secret key (
i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, 𝑐𝑖, in the ciphertext, 𝑐, is computed as

𝑐𝑖=(𝑝𝑖+𝑘) % 26

wherein % 26 here means “remainder when dividing by 26.” This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated
than it is, but it’s really just a concise way of expressing the algorithm precisely. Indeed, for the sake of
discussion, think of A (or a) as 0, B (or b) as 1, …, H (or h) as 7, I (or i) as 8, …, and Z (or z) as 25. Suppose that
Caesar just wants to say  `Hi`  to someone confidentially using, this time, a key, 𝑘, of 3. And so his plaintext, 𝑝,
is  `Hi`, in which case his plaintext’s first character, 𝑝0, is  `H`  (aka 7), and his plaintext’s second character,
𝑝1, is  `i`  (aka 8). His ciphertext’s first character, 𝑐0, is thus  `K`, and his ciphertext’s second character, 𝑐1, is
thus  `L`. Make sense?

In a file called  `caesar.c`  in a folder called  `caesar`, write a program that enables you to encrypt messages using
Caesar’s cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument,
what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime. We shouldn’t necessarily assume that the user’s
key is going to be a number; though you may assume that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.

## Specification

Design and implement a program,  `caesar`, that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.

- Implement your program in a file called  `caesar.c`  in a directory called  `caesar`.
- Your program must accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer. Let’s call it 𝑘 for the sake of
  discussion.
- If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your
  program should print an error message of your choice (with  `printf`) and return from  `main`  a value of  `1`  (which
  tends to signify an error) immediately.
- If any of the characters of the command-line argument is not a decimal digit, your program should print the
  message  `Usage: ./caesar key`  and return from  `main`  a value of  `1`.
- Do not assume that 𝑘 will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values
  of 𝑘 less than 231−26. In other words, you don’t need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a
  value for 𝑘 that’s too big or almost too big to fit in an  `int`. (Recall that an  `int`  can overflow.) But, even if
  𝑘 is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program’s input should remain alphabetical characters in your
  program’s output. For instance, if 𝑘 is 27,  `A`  should not become  `\`  even though  `\`  is 27 positions away
  from  `A`  in ASCII, per  [asciitable.com](https://www.asciitable.com/);  `A`  should become  `B`, since  `B`  is 27
  positions away from  `A`, provided you wrap around from  `Z`  to  `A`.
- Your program must output  `plaintext:` (with two spaces but without a newline) and then prompt the user for
  a  `string`  of plaintext (using  `get_string`).
- Your program must output  `ciphertext:` (with one space but without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s
  corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext “rotated” by  _k_  positions;
  non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
- Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase
  letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.
- After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning  `0`
  from  `main`.

## Advice

How to begin? Let’s approach this problem one step at a time.

### Pseudocode

First write, try to write a  `main`  function in  `caesar.c`  that implements the program using just pseudocode, even if
not (yet!) sure how to write it in actual code.

### Counting Command-Line Arguments

Whatever your pseudocode, let’s first write only the C code that checks whether the program was run with a single
command-line argument before adding additional functionality.

Specifically, modify  `main`  in  `caesar.c`  in such a way that, if the user provides no command-line arguments, or two
or more, the function prints  `"Usage: ./caesar key\n"`  and then returns  `1`, effectively exiting the program. If the
user provides exactly one command-line argument, the program should print nothing and simply return  `0`. The program
should thus behave per the below.

```
$ ./caesar
Usage: ./caesar key

```

```
$ ./caesar 1 2 3
Usage: ./caesar key

```

```
$ ./caesar 1

```

### Checking the Key

Now that your program is (hopefully!) accepting input as prescribed, it’s time for another step.

Add to  `caesar.c`, below  `main`, a function called, e.g.,  `only_digits`  that takes a  `string`  as an argument and
returns  `true`  if that  `string`  contains only digits,  `0`  through  `9`, else it returns  `false`. Be sure to add
the function’s prototype above  `main`  as well.

Then modify  `main`  in such a way that it calls  `only_digits`  on  `argv[1]`. If that function returns  `false`,
then  `main`  should print  `"Usage: ./caesar key\n"`  and return  `1`. Else  `main`  should simply return  `0`. The
program should thus behave per the below:

```
$ ./caesar 42

```

```
$ ./caesar banana
Usage: ./caesar key

```

### Using the Key

Now modify  `main`  in such a way that it converts  `argv[1]`  to an  `int`. You might find  `atoi`, declared
in  `stdlib.h`, to be helpful, per  [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/). And then use  `get_string`  to prompt the
user for some plaintext with  `"plaintext: "`.

Then, implement a function called, e.g.,  `rotate`, that takes a  `char`  as input and also an  `int`, and rotates
that  `char`  by that many positions if it’s a letter (i.e., alphabetical), wrapping around from  `Z`  to  `A`  (and
from  `z`  to  `a`) as needed. If the  `char`  is not a letter, the function should instead return the same  `char`
unchanged.

Then modify  `main`  in such a way that it prints  `"ciphertext: "`  and then iterates over every  `char`  in the user’s
plaintext, calling  `rotate`  on each, and printing the return value thereof.
