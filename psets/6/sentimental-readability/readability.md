# Readability

## Problem to Solve

Write, in a file called  `readability.py`  in a folder called  `sentimental-readability`, a program that first asks the user to type in some text, and then outputs the grade level for the text, according to the Coleman-Liau formula, exactly as you did in  [Problem Set 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/), except that your program this time should be written in Python.
