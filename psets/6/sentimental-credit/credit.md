# Credit

## Problem to Solve

In a filed called  `credit.py`  in a folder called  `sentimental-credit`, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via  `print`) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in  [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/). Your program this time should be written in Python!
