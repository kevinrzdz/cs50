# Hello, Again

## Problem to Solve

In a file called  `hello.py`  in a folder called  `sentimental-hello`, implement a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints  `hello, so-and-so`, where  `so-and-so`  is their provided name, exactly as you did in  [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/). Except that your program this time should be written in Python!
