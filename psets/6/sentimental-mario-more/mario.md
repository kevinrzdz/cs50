## Problem to Solve

In a file called  `mario.py`  in a folder called  `sentimental-mario-more`, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks, exactly as you did in  [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/). Your program this time should be written in Python!
